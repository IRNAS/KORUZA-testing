# KORUZA portable mount

Wireless optical system KORUZA can be mos easily demonstrated or calibrated when put on  sufficiently stable mounting. So far we have used a concrete tile with a mounting bracket, which is very stable but significantly to heavy for shipping or demonstration purposes. Thus, we have developed a lighter and small-form factor version that can be easily shipped inside a box. The new design uses commonly available aluminium extruded profiles and some nuts and bolts from a hardware store.
